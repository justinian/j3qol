# Justinian3's QoL Mod

This mod adds new variants to some existing structures with QoL improvements.
There are no new engrams or items for the structures, they are only variants of
the existing structures (press R to switch variants while placing the
structure). So far:

* Versions of the Vault and Large and Small Storage Boxes with a configurable
  number of slots
* Versions of the Feeding Trough and Air Conditioner with improved range (and
  insulation), also configurable
* Versions of the Standing and Wall torches that don't use fuel and
  automatically turn on/off with the day/night cycle

Inspired by the S+/QoL+ structures, but implemented from scratch using the new ASA structures.
